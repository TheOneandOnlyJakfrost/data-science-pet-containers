# Quick Start
1. Clone this repository and `cd data-science-pet-containers/containers`.
2. Copy `sample.env` to `.env`. Edit `.env` and change all of the email addresses and passwords.
3. `docker-compose up -d --build`. The first time you run this, it will take some time. Once the images are built it will be faster. 

    When it's done you'll see

    ```
    Creating containers_pgadmin4_1 ... done
    Creating containers_postgis_1  ... done
    Creating containers_rstats_1   ... done
    ```

4. To stop the services, type `docker-compose stop`. To start them back up again, `docker-compose start`.

    Stopped containers and their filesystems will persist across host reboots. To destroy them, type `docker-compose down`. ***You will lose all the data in the containers if you do this!***
