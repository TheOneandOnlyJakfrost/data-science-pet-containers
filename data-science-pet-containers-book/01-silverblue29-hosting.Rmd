The original goal of this project was to provide a pet container enviromnet for Fedora Silverblue. Silverblue 29 was released on October 30, 2018.

    See <https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/> for install instructions.
2. Perform any required software upgrades and reboot.
3. Clone <https://github,com/znmeb/data-science-pet-containers.git>.
4. `cd data-science-pet-containers/Silverblue`.
5. `sudo ./root-setup.bash`. This installs all the container hosting software you need.
6. Reboot. When the machine comes back up, proceed with installation. That's next, in [Quick Start].
