# Overview
Data Science Pet Containers comprise a collection of open-source software for all phases of the data science workflow, from ingestion of raw data through visualization, exploration, analysis and reporting. We provide the following tools:

* PostgreSQL / PostGIS / pgRouting: an industrial strength relational database management system with geographic information systems (GIS) extensions,
* pgAdmin4, a web-based graphical user interface for PostgreSQL, and
* A comprehsive set of R language tools, including RStudioÂ® Server.

As the name implies, the software is distributed via Docker. The user simply clones a Git repository and uses the command `docker-compose up` to bring up the services.

## Why do it this way? 

* Provide a standardized common working environment for data scientists and DevOps engineers. We want to build using the same tools we'll use for deployment as much as possible.
* Isolation: for the most part, software running in containers is contained. It interacts with the desktop / laptop user through well-defined mechanisms, often as a web server.
* Modern Linux workstations, like Fedora Silverblue, make it easy to offload a data science workflow to containers.

## About the name
This all started with an infamous "cattle, not pets" blog post. For some history, see <http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/the-history-of-pets-vs-cattle/>. In the Red Hat / Kubernetes / OpenShift universe, it's common for people to have a workstation that's essentially a Docker / Kubernetes host with all the actual work being done in containers. See <https://rhelblog.redhat.com/2016/06/08/in-defense-of-the-pet-container-part-1-prelude-the-only-constant-is-complexity/> and <https://www.projectatomic.io/blog/2018/02/fedora-atomic-workstation/>.

So - pet containers for data scientists.
