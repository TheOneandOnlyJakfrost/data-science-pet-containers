I’m forking this project to clean it up for use outside of Hack Oregon.
There are a lot of things in there that are specific to Hack Oregon,

Arch Linux and Fedora Silverblue 29. This last - formerly known as
Fedora Ataomic Workstation - was the original inspiration for doing
this. The Silverblue environment is designed for a
“pet-container-centric” workload.

I’m rebuilding the documentation with Bookdown. That’s in the source now
but I haven’t published it anywhere. License will be Creative Commans
