# Data Science Pet Containers

## Update - 17 September 2018

I’m forking this project to clean it up for use outside of Hack Oregon.
There are a lot of things in there that are specific to Hack Oregon,
like the Amazon Linux image, that don’t make sense for other users.

My working test environments are Windows 10 Pro with Docker for Windows,
Arch Linux and Fedora Silverblue 29. This last - formerly known as
Fedora Ataomic Workstation - was the original inspiration for doing
this. The Silverblue environment is designed for a
“pet-container-centric” workload.

I’m rebuilding the documentation with Bookdown. That’s in the source now
but I haven’t published it anywhere. License will be Creative Commans
